# MyReads Project

## Description
My first React project!  This is a simple book tracking app that is wired up to a simple Book API that has limited search terms.  This app allows you to keep track of what books you want to read, which books you've read, and which books you are currently reading, as well as some searching functionality which eventually is pulling from google books.   

The project's intent was to help me learn how state in React works, inverse data flow, and React Router as well as general familiarity.  

## Instructions
To get started, perform the following:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Technologies used
This project is built with React components, including React Router, as well as a BooksAPI which was provided for this simple project.  There are some other helper imports such as PropTypes to ensure safe props.
